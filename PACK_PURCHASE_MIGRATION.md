# Pack Purchase & Opening Migration Guide

Complete guide for migrating from basic pack purchasing to enhanced pack purchase with real NFT data and animations.

## üéØ Overview

**Current:** Basic transaction handling ‚Üí Generic pack opening animation  
**Enhanced:** Complete transaction lifecycle ‚Üí Real NFT data ‚Üí Pack opening with actual cards  
**Benefits:** Real pack contents, better UX, automatic inventory updates

## üöÄ What's New

### Enhanced Features
- **Real Pack Data**: Fetch actual NFTs from the pack purchase
- **Rich Animations**: Show the real cards that were minted
- **Better State Management**: Detailed progress tracking (`fetching-pack` state)
- **Auto Inventory Update**: No manual refresh needed
- **Error Recovery**: Fallback methods for getting pack data
- **Pack Summaries**: Show total stats, types, rarities

### Flow Comparison

**Before:**
```
Buy Pack ‚Üí Transaction ‚Üí Generic Animation ‚Üí Manual Inventory Refresh
```

**After:**
```
Buy Pack ‚Üí Transaction ‚Üí Fetch Real NFTs ‚Üí Show Real Cards ‚Üí Auto Update Inventory
```

## üìÅ New Files Created

### Core Functionality
1. **`hooks/use-nadmon-pack-buying-enhanced.ts`** - Enhanced pack buying hook
2. **`components/pack-opening-enhanced.tsx`** - Real NFT pack opening animation
3. **`components/shop-popup-enhanced.tsx`** - Enhanced shop with pack previews
4. **`components/pack-purchase-demo.tsx`** - Side-by-side comparison demo

### Key Improvements
- **Pack ID Extraction**: Attempts to get pack ID from transaction receipt
- **API Integration**: Fetches real pack data from backend
- **Fallback Methods**: Multiple ways to get pack data if event parsing fails
- **Rich Animations**: Cards reveal one by one with stats and rarity indicators

## üîß Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Update Environment
Ensure your `.env.local` has the backend URL:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8081
```

### Step 2: Test Enhanced Hook

Add to your test page:
```typescript
import { PackPurchaseDemo } from '@/components/pack-purchase-demo'

// Add to component
<PackPurchaseDemo />
```

### Step 3: Update Main Page

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/page.tsx
import { useNadmonPackBuying } from '@/hooks/use-nadmon-pack-buying'
import { ShopPopup } from '@/components/shop-popup'

const { buyPackWithMON, state, error } = useNadmonPackBuying()
```

**Enhanced Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/page.tsx
import { useNadmonPackBuyingEnhanced } from '@/hooks/use-nadmon-pack-buying-enhanced'
import { ShopPopupEnhanced } from '@/components/shop-popup-enhanced'

const { buyPackWithMON, state, error, packNFTs, packId } = useNadmonPackBuyingEnhanced()
```

### Step 4: Update Shop Component

Replace the shop popup:
```typescript
// Old
{activePopup === "shop" && (
  <ShopPopup
    onClose={() => setActivePopup(null)}
    onPackSelect={handlePackSelect}
    onPackPurchased={() => refetchNFTs()}
  />
)}

// New
{activePopup === "shop" && (
  <ShopPopupEnhanced
    onClose={() => setActivePopup(null)}
    onPackPurchased={() => refetchNFTs()}
    onInventoryUpdate={() => refetchNFTs()}
  />
)}
```

## üéÆ Enhanced User Experience

### Pack Purchase Flow

1. **Select Pack**: Visual pack cards with pricing and description
2. **Choose Payment**: Toggle between MON and COOKIES
3. **Purchase**: Enhanced progress tracking with detailed status
4. **Real-time Updates**: 
   - "Confirm Transaction" ‚Üí "Transaction Processing" ‚Üí "Getting Your Cards" ‚Üí "Success"
5. **Pack Opening**: 
   - Pack shakes and rips open
   - Cards revealed one by one with animations
   - Real NFT data displayed with stats
   - Pack summary with totals

### State Management

The enhanced hook provides detailed states:
```typescript
type PackBuyingState = 'idle' | 'pending' | 'confirming' | 'success' | 'error' | 'fetching-pack'
```

- **`fetching-pack`**: New state when retrieving NFT data from API
- **`packNFTs`**: Array of real NFTs from the pack
- **`packId`**: The actual pack ID from the transaction

### Error Handling

Multiple fallback methods:
1. **Event Parsing**: Try to extract pack ID from transaction receipt
2. **Recent Pack Lookup**: Query API for user's most recent pack
3. **Retry Logic**: Multiple attempts with exponential backoff
4. **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error descriptions

## üîç API Integration Details

### Pack Data Retrieval

```typescript
// Get pack by specific ID
GET /api/packs/{packId}

// Response includes all NFT data
{
  "pack_id": 161,
  "player": "0x...",
  "payment_type": "MON",
  "purchased_at": "2025-07-05T15:39:56Z",
  "token_ids": [161, 162, 163, 164, 165],
  "nfts": [
    {
      "id": 161,
      "name": "urchin",
      "type": "Grass",
      "rarity": "Common",
      "hp": 112,
      "attack": 24,
      "image": "https://...",
      // ... complete NFT data
    }
    // ... 4 more NFTs
  ],
  "total_nfts": 5
}
```

### Fallback Strategy

If pack ID extraction fails:
```typescript
// Query recent packs for user
GET /api/players/{address}/packs

// Find most recent pack (within last 2 minutes)
// Then fetch that pack's details
```
